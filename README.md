# IRI Mapping Validator
### _for Australian Government Linked Data Working Group-issued IRIs_

This repository contains a simple set of scripts for validating the mappings of persistent IRIs allocated by the [Australian Government Linked Data Working Group (AGLDWG)](https://www.linked.data.gov.au).

The script - a Python script - operates by sending Internet requests for each AGLDWG managed persistent IRI and comparing the responses with the static comparison data stored in this repository.
